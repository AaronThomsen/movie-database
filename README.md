# Movie Database
Database of the highest-grossing movies (as of Spring 2017. The code above is in a Visual Studio format; If you only want to see the .cpp/.h files, they are located in the **Team8_Project** folder.

The database was the final project for my Data Structures class, where we had to combine various data structures to act as some sort of database. The following data structures were used in our project:

* Hash Table *(collisions resolved with quadratic probing)*
* Stack 
* Binary Search Tree

The program allows the user to update the movie database (add/delete movies), undo a delete, search for a movie, display the movies in various ways, compare the gross total of two movies, and save the current database (including any changes) to a text file. All user input is validated to prevent the program from crashing.

Below are a few screenshots.
